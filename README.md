Bitcoin Symmetric Key Generation using Elliptic Curve Cryptography 
Here i've used two major functions of Elliptic Curve Cryptography 

1. Point Addition ECCAdd 
2. Point Doubling ECCDou

with the use of SECP256k1 Domain Parameters which are p,a,b,G,n,h and also known as set of Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters.
Equation for ECDSA is Y^2 = X^3 + aX + b where a = 0, b = 7.
